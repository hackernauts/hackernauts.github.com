# About
<hr />
Ego hack, ergo sum. This site is about exploring the security and technology landscape. It is written primarality for the relitive newcomer to infosec in general, or hacking in particular. The posts are designed to enable somebody with a reasonable level of technical skill do and understand some of the things that a hacker would do. If you find you like it, there is also some advanced content posted occasionally, and I publish links to other excellent security sites, blogs, and tools.

## About the site

* The site is built on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) with a custom theme written by me.
* I write posts in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and use the default jekyll parser. I want to use [redcarpet](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet) at some point, but it will require some rewriting.
* The code theme is a very slightly altered version of monokai and is produced by [pygments](http://pygments.org/).
* The entire site lives in a github repository. I can't really recommend that you clone it, cause there is still some spaghetti code and gotchas, so not ready for any kind of production.
* A few words about the [linked list](http://shawnblanc.net/2009/08/the-link-post/) posts Ã  la [gruber](http://twitter.com/gruber). I do them, the hash-bang near the post title is the anchor to my post about it, if you need it.
* I only really worry about modern browsers. Really just my browsers. Sorry if the site looks crappy in yours.
