A file that is simultaneously many valid filetypes. This hit the internet the other day. Perhaps it is my inexperience with this type of thing, but I was blown away. From the readme:

>CorkaMIX.exe is simultaneously a valid:

> * Windows Portable Executable binary
 * Adobe Reader PDF document
 * Oracle Java JAR (a CLASS inside a ZIP)/Python script
 * HTML page
 
How crazy is that? Apparently written 100% in assembler.
