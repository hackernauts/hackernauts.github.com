Great resource for learning this side of security. I feel there is a tendency to specialize in the infosec field, which is not a bad thing. People should be really good at the stuff that interests them, that is a given. Teach yourself something new, that is the mindset of a hacker. So here is a great way to do that. This site:

>[...]provides a variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, [and] reverse engineering

3 virtual machines, each with a clear goal. Teach yourself something cool today.
