Tor Chat is an anonymous chat client. I know that you like privacy, and sometimes its pretty convenient to just send that sensitive information in a chat, and AOL just won't cut it. From the wiki:

>TorChat is a peer to peer instant messenger with a completely decentralized design, built on top of Tor's location hidden services, giving you extremely strong anonymity while being very easy to use without the need to install or configure anything.

If you are somewhere that Tor is blocked, like China or some companies, you are still out of luck.
