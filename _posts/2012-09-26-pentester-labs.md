This deserves not just a link, but serious praise. Hackernauts exists in part to chronicle some basic techniques of hacking. The Pentester Labs is exactly this: a set of downloadable, throughly researched, well-documented labs that allow you to perform what in my experience are *real* and *useful* exploits in actual situations. Requires some sort of VM tool, of course [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) is free, and [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html) is good. Both work well. If you want to learn to Pen Test, you better be doing these.
