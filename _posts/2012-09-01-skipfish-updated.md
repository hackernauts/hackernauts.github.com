Skipfish has been bumped a version. In addition to a few additional tests it now supports authenticated scans. From the release notes:

> Added form based authentication. During these authenticated scans, skipfish will check if the session has ended and re-authenticates if necessary.

From fairly useful to extremely so in just one note.
