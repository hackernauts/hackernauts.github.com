This one is *really* for the nerds. And although this is not for hackers, per se, I have been having a ton of fun with it. Most good hackers end up writing code at some point, and to do that you need a text editor that you can trust. The site lets you select your text editor of choice, and then drills you with the shortcut keys that make using a text editor so delightful and campy. There is a $5 charge to setup your own drills, but they give you enough freebies that its still fun, even if you don't pay. To be honest, I am running a few Textmate drills in the morning after playing on [TyprX](http://app.typrx.com/cd /) to make my keyboarding skills even better. So I am gonna throw them five bucks once I have mastered the free drills. Regardless, neat.
