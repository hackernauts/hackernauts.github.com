Paul Asadoorian dissects password security, and speaks about what works, what doesn't, and  why people continue to use things that don't work. A common misconception about password security is that a *hash* makes a password *secure*. This is not the case, especially when you consider that a hash is simply a fingerprint. It isn't really *encryption* per se. From Paul:

> The bottom line is if an attacker is using modern password-cracking hardware, complexity matters little. What does matter is the length of your password, which can help to increase the time it would take for an attacker to crack your password. Again, many websites limit the length and defeat one of the only protections you have in this scenario.

There have been a pile of password hashes leaked recently, from eHarmony, LinkedIn, etc. Some people wonder 'what is going on that all these sites are suddenly getting popped?' Wrong question really. Most of the sites got popped months ago, they just cracked the easy passwords and left the harder ones up to the power of the Internet when they got bored. Methinks the timing of the leaks had something more to do with bragging rights in the underground.
